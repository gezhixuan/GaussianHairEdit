## Example Data

To get started, please [download](https://entuedu-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/yuxuan003_e_ntu_edu_sg/ESUUkBSZA1lJk-11McWKfo8B1GmXD_Nzy88cSHGxdKiFkA?e=vYgTDf) the input examples and place the unpacked folder under `VcEdit/gs_data`.

The example data are from [InstructN2N](https://instruct-nerf2nerf.github.io) and [DreamEditor](https://github.com/zjy526223908/DreamEditor?tab=readme-ov-file), where the trained 3DGS model are generated by first running colmap and then trained using [gaussian splatting](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting). Please refer to the [original gaussian splatting repository](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting) for more details about preparing your own data.

## Start Editing
We provide several sample scripts for running the editing process. For example:

`bash script/man_clown.sh`

The editing process typically takes 10 to 25 minutes on a single A100 GPU, depending on the scene size and the number of iterations. The GPU memory usage ranges between 20GB and 40GB. For panorama samples the memory cost for processing all views (which is unnecessary w.r.t. the performance) is a bit higher than 40GB, you can remove some views in the dataset.

<!-- Note that our editing is based on the image editing achieved by [InfEdit](https://github.com/sled-group/InfEdit/tree/main). Due to the diversity of editing scenarios, not all the prompt generates satisfying results. For example, some prompts lead to editing failure or drastic multi-view inconsistency in InfEdit. Please first try image editing using your prompt in [InfEdit](https://github.com/sled-group/InfEdit/tree/main) for prompt availability and satisfying hyper-parameters. -->

Our editing framework builds upon the image editing capabilities provided by [InfEdit](https://github.com/sled-group/InfEdit/tree/main). Due to the diverse nature of editing scenarios, not all prompts yield satisfying results. Some prompts may result in editing failures or too drastic multi-view inconsistencies when using InfEdit.
Before using this framework, we recommend testing your prompts in [InfEdit](https://github.com/sled-group/InfEdit/tree/main) to ensure:

* Prompt compatibility with the editing process.
* Optimal hyper-parameter selection for achieving desired results.
